# The Outpost

The Outpost is a book blog, built as a capstone project for a web development course. Functionality includes liking and saving posts, but these are cosmetic and last only for a session, since no database is attached to the project.

### Running *The Outpost*

The site is hosted on Github Pages. Navigate your browser to https://esmuts.github.io/the-outpost/.

### Usage

The site is mostly a skin at the moment. Blog entries are lipsum, and functionality including likes and saving posts are session duration only. Comments and contact forms are not linked to any actions. Look around, let me know if you find any bugs, or have suggestions for improvement!

### Credits

I made *The Outpost* as a capstone project for a full-stack web development course I'm doing at https://www.hyperiondev.com.
